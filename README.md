Hi,

For whoever is viewing this repo, this is a past group project that my teammates and I accomplished and once published through GitHub. But it's no longer available due to various reasons. I am very proud of our work. So I built this repo to archive the work we built here and to showcase my skill set. All of our team members contributed to all the notebooks we constructed and the website we created to present our work. I hosted the website in my school domain to present our story. Please find the website here. https://xliu.georgetown.domains/502/

I am still editing other documents we used since they contain certain personal information, keys, and links.

Thank you for visiting!
